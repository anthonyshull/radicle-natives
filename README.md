# Radicle Natives
![CI](https://github.com/anthonyshull/radicle-natives/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Radicle Natives is an experiment in desert ecology.
We grow native, drought-resistant trees and shrubs as alternatives to water-guzzling ornamentals.
And, we do so using sustainable, precision agricultural practices.

This repository will house three main projects:
- Software that ingests data from an [ecowitt](https://www.ecowitt.com/shop/homePage) weather station
- Software that ingests data from a custom-built flow meter
- The Radicle Natives website

## Execute

The easiest way to run Radicle Natives is to use Docker Compose:

```
%> docker-compose up
```
